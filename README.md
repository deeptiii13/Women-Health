Nowadays women are at par with men in all spheres of life, they are working as successful doctors, engineers, professionals, entrepreneurs etc. Women do not feel free to talk about their health. In some cases it becomes life-threatening. Talking about women related health issues is still a big taboo in most parts of India. 

Sections of the website include:
- Mental Health: 
  It is quite common for women to suffer from postpartum depression, eating disorders, anxiety disorders and others but instead of being considerate people judge them for having changed, not taking proper care of the children, being irritable, etc. This further pushes women back into the holes of darkness and self-doubt.
- Physical Health: 
  Young girls facing acne or skin issues due to hormonal changes or pregnant women facing hair loss and vitamin deficiency after delivery and so on kower their self esteem instead of talking out with people, finding solutions to their problems and knowing that these things are natural and will eventually wear out.
- Sexual Health: 
  In India, sex education is not given prime importance and talking about is considered to be a taboo in the society, consequently women are hesitant to share their worries with others and hence are inclined towards home remedies spread on the Internet which may be life-threatening in certain cases. 
- Pregnancy Health: 
  Not every pregnant woman has someone to tell her what is right and what is wrong at all stages of pregnancy, certain doubts always arise in their minds, however they donot have anybody to answer them. Post-pregnancy it is quite essential for women to take care of themselves as their body is deficient in all aspects but they donot have the right guidance by their side.
- Menstrual Health: 
  In certain areas, awareness about menstruation is still missing. They consider it impure rather than understanding that is is a life process. Even in urban areas, wonen are not expected to talk about it openly. This platform helps them to talk their heart out and know everything about their cycle.
  
A mental health quiz has been generated in order to test the symptoms, machine learning is yet to be introduced to the the same.

A period tracker has been created to help women keep a track of their cycles, so they donot have to worry all the time about remebering the dates.

A discussion forum has been created for women where they can express their views, perceptions and concerns anonymously. The queries can be answered by women who have been through the same situation. In this way, women who are otherwise scared to discuss their issues openly would be able to do so.

Appointments can be scheduled with the doctors in order to discuss their problems without losing out on their identity if they wish.

Helpline Numbers sections has been added in order to help the women with suicidal tendencies or women with labour pain etc.
